Plant Tracker
-------------

> This website is still under development! Please check back later to see its progress.
  
This project was started as a way to practice my Django and Web Developent skills.

As it's still in its early stages, there is almost no content in the website.

Next Steps:
1. Finish Homepage: UI (Buttons lead nowhere and have no code), Backend(Get plant information from API to autofill data in UI);
2. Create a Settings page (Allow users to change their user information, including profile picture);
3. Allow user to login and logout (Create a Login page and set it to Index. Create a logout button in a dropdown menu on the Navbar);
4. Write instructions on how to deploy website locally, in github repo.
5. If possible, host website using Heroku;
6. More Later...
